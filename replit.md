## Overview

Django 4.2 airline management and reservation mini-project for a lab demo. The Django app is the primary user-facing project and runs from `manage.py` on port 5000.

## Django Airline System

- **Project**: `airline_manager`
- **Apps**:
  - `accounts` — Passenger/user records
  - `flights` — City, aircraft, route, schedule, flight search, dashboard and Control Tower data entry
  - `seats` — Seat map and cabin pricing modifiers
  - `bookings` — Reservations, coupons, payments, dynamic pricing signals
  - `tracking` — Live C&D/check-in/gate event log
  - `agents` — Staff/agent-assisted bookings
  - `chatbot` — Database-backed FAQ entries and chat messages
  - `delays` — Delay alerts and accommodation support
- **Database**: SQLite by default (`db.sqlite3`, generated locally); settings include environment hooks for PostgreSQL-style DB variables.
- **Async stack**: Celery configured in `airline_manager/celery.py` with Redis URL support through `REDIS_URL`; eager execution is enabled by default for the lab preview so the app works without a separate worker.
- **Key features**:
  - Flight listing and city/route search
  - Operations dashboard
  - Custom Control Tower at `/control-tower/` for adding cities, coupons, flights with generated seat maps, and sample bookings
  - Dynamic fare calculation through booking signals
  - Visual seat selection with economy, premium, and business pricing
  - Passenger and agent-assisted booking flows
  - PNR-based live tracking for flight status, check-in, and document/C&D checks
  - Delay accommodation alerts for meal, hotel, and rebooking support
  - Coupon chatbot using database FAQ rows and stored chat messages
  - Custom Django admin labels and registered model admin panels
- **Seed data**: `flights.seed.ensure_seed_data()` creates cities, aircraft, routes, seats, coupons, agents, FAQ entries, delay alerts, and sample bookings. It is called from the main views so the lab demo stays populated.
